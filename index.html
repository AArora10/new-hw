        <p> One of my many hobbies is dancing. i like it because it has no rules. you can create your dance routine by addding whatever you want whenever you want. creating a dance boosts your creativity skill but  dancing itself is a good exercise. dance comes in many formes like hip hop, jazz, pop E.T.C. i like freestlye. Freestyle is when you choose the steps and the music and every single thing.  </p>
